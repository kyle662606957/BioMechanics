# BioMechanics
1.Overview
===
With the motion data gathered by Kinect, the intersegmental forces are calculated as shown in the video. The inertial parameters are calculated with the De Leva Dataset, and a top-down inverse dynamics model are programmed to solve the forces. 

2.Usage
===
 class bodySegment: To define a bodysegment with the necessary information
 class humanBody: To construct a human model with the several bodySegments
 
3.Example
===
