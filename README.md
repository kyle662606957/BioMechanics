# BioMechanics
1.Overview
===
With the motion data gathered by Kinect, the intersegmental forces are calculated as shown in the video. The inertial parameters are calculated with the De Leva Dataset, and a top-down inverse dynamics model are programmed to solve the forces. 

2.Usage
===
 a)class bodySegment: To define a bodysegment with necessary information
 
 b)class humanBody: To construct a human model with several bodySegments
 
3.Example
